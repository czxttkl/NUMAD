    <string name="about_text_debug">Debug is a reality-augmented game which encourages people do exercise in a fun way. You will get a lot of sweat while using your feet to \"burn\" and \"squash\" bugs on the screen. Relax! They are not real, but almost! Rendered in 3D models, they are even smart enough to dodge your shoes and bounce right after hitting edges of floors. &lt;br />&lt;br />We have minimized the requirements of playing the game. Things you need to make sure:&lt;br />1. A good light condition while playing&lt;br />2. Sticky notes/markers of a high contrast color with the floor.&lt;br />&lt;br />Happy debugging!</string>
